### Banking Data Analytics

This is an end-to-end Data Analytics project focused on analyzing banking customer data to derive actionable business insights related to deposits, loans, and customer segmentation.

### Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

MySQL

Power BI

VS Code

### Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing using Pandas

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. Univariate Analysis

4. Bivariate Analysis

5. Correlation Heatmap

6. Data stored and queried using MySQL

7. Interactive dashboards built in Power BI


### Key Analysis Performed:

1. Classified customers based on income levels and segmented them into three groups: Low, Medium, and High income bands.

2. Conducted univariate analysis to understand the distribution and behavior of each individual feature in the dataset.

3. Performed bivariate analysis to compare relationships between different variables and identify meaningful patterns.

4. Built a correlation heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix and determine which features are strongly or weakly related to each other.

### Four interactive dashboards were created:

1. Home Dashboard – Overview of key KPIs

2. Deposit Analysis – Savings & deposit behavior insights

3. Loan Analysis – Loan distribution and risk trends

4. Summary Dashboard – Overall customer financial profile

### Key Insights: 
1. Customers in the medium income band tend to take higher loan amounts compared to other income groups, indicating strong credit demand within this segment.

2. The KDE distribution shows a right-skewed pattern, suggesting that only a small proportion of customers hold very high account balances while the majority maintain relatively lower balances.

3. The correlation heatmap reveals the strongest positive relationships between bank deposits and other account types such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and foreign currency accounts.
This indicates that customers who maintain high balances in one account type are likely to hold substantial funds across multiple banking products, highlighting a high-value, multi-product customer segment.
